Updated config file with "hasCronSchedule" setting in each job configuration

Should be set to "1" if jobs are to be run as cron jobs (in which case the "period" 
setting is irrelevant because job script will not loop, it will run once and exit)

Jobs:
    twitter-search:
        hasCronSchedule: 1
        period: 30
    image-process:
        hasCronSchedule: 1
        period: 30
        dbLimit: 100
        imgLimit: 100
    mosaic-build:
        hasCronSchedule: 1
        period: 60

Added config/locale.yaml, language mapping requested by Sta≈õ@mozilla
Mozilla's localization team wants to have some degree of control over this file.
