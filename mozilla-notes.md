# Install notes / questions

* bootstrap.php has hardcoded debug log paths to /var/log/twitterparty/
    * Need to be able to configure or turn that off

* Where is the /servers/cache/twitter-collage directory location configured? 
    * Is this actually public/store?

* config/mosaic-48x47.config.php - config file needed, but nowhere to be found

* color-import.php does not exist

* /var/log/twitter-collage renamed to /var/log/twitterparty
